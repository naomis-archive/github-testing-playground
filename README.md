# github-testing-playground

A repository to test pull requests/issues. Feel free to create issues and submit pull requests to practise using the GitHub interface. Anyone is welcome to do so.

If you are new to git or GitHub, you can view my tutorial for more information (link is coming soon!)

Please note: IF your pull request contains malicious code or harassment, I will block you from this repository.
